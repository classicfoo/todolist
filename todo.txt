Implement JavaScript for Main Page (main.js):

X Attach click event listeners to each task to handle selection.
X Store selected task details in localStorage or another client-side storage option.
Redirect the user to the task-edit page upon task selection.
Implement JavaScript for Task-Edit Page (task-edit.js):

On page load, check for stored task details in localStorage.
Populate the task editing form with the details from localStorage.
Implement the autosave feature that triggers on input field changes.
Add an event listener to the delete icon to handle task deletion.
Clear the task details from localStorage after loading them to prevent stale data issues.
Develop Data Handling Logic:

Structure a method to store tasks (e.g., an array of objects).
Create functions to add, update, and delete tasks.
Ensure that changes are reflected in localStorage and the task list.
Create Autosave Functionality:

Implement a debounce function to limit how often the autosave can fire during input.
Save changes to localStorage or your chosen data store.
